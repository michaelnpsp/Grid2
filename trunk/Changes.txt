---------------------------------------------------------------------------^

Grid2Options: Implemented a Test mode for Layouts in Options. When a layout is 
in test mode, normal grid2 frames are hidden and replaced width test frames, 
allowing to check the total size and appearance of the layout.

*Grid2: Speed optimizations in StatusAura.lua

---------------------------------------------------------------------------^

*Grid2: Implemented two indicator:update() functions, with blink and without blink. 
Configuring Blink to "None" in options will enable the faster function, but we
lost support for blinking indicators.

*Grid2Options: Added a test-mode for indicators, when this mode is enabled
all indicators will show some test info.

*Grid2: StatusRange.lua refactoring, ranges implemented in a more simple way.
Little speed optimization in timer sheduler.
Removed GridRange.lua 
Removed GridUtils.lua

* Grid2Options,Grid2: Added Cooldown Text configuration to Icon Indicators, 
posibility to disable OmniCC for icon cooldowns.

* Grid2: Implemented a poweralt status to show chogal corruption, atremedes sound, etc.
Code placed in statusmana.lua, TODO: rename statusmana.lua to statuspower.lua or move
status code to poweralt.lua

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------^

*Grid2RaidDebuffsOptions: New configuration for Grid2RaidDebuffs, now the raid debuffs 
spells can be configured, enabled or disabled, posibility to generate a standard debuff 
status based on any raid-debuf.

r1004 | michael | 2011-04-02
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------^

*Grid2,Grid2Options: Bar indicators full refactoring. New bar indicators can be
created, for example to show a mana bar or any other compatible status. 
health and heals bar indicators are not special now: can be removed, created and
placed anywhere.

*Grid2Options: Frames background color option moved to general options.

r1002 | michael | 2011-03-29
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------^

*Grid2: Moved some libraries to Grid2Options

*Grid2: Fixed a inconsistency with textures in bars indicators: 
Added a general frame background texture option, and now health 
and heals textures are independent.

*Grid2: Replaced utf8 library with a much more simple and fast version:
no validations needed to make a strsub.

*Grid2Options: enUS locale cleaned.

*Grid2Options: Avoid deletion of statuses in use.

*Grid2Options: Buffs/debuffs creation changes. Now you can type a spellId number, 
the provided spellId becomes validated and translated to spellName.
The spellId number is saved in database so the buff/debuff status
continues working against client language changes.

* Grid2Options: Buffs creation changes: now we can select the number 
of colors the new buff must provide. For example, if we created a buff
"Lifebloom" we can specify 3 colors, to track the Lifebloom stacks.

* Grid2,Grid2Options: Added color option to health-deficit status

*Gri2Options: Changes in translation code. Specially buffs and debuffs
for example a buff called: buff-Lifebloom-mine becomes splited and translated 
in this way:   L["buff-"] .. L["Lifebloom"] .. L["-mine"]

Now a descriptive prefix to buffs/debuffs can be supplied: For example:
You can create a debuff called:  
Chimaeron>Low Health  
And grid2 will use correct debuff name "Low Health" but continues displaying 
Chimaeron>Low Health in debuffs list (allowed separators @#>).

*Grid2,Grid2Options:  Added Grid2:UnregisterStatus() in GridStatus.lua to allow a 
clean status deletion in Grid2Options. 

*Grid2Options: Cleaned and completed spanish localization (TODO the same to enUS locale)

*Grid2Options: Now icon, square and text indicators can change type correcty. Incompatible
statuses are removed. Some changes in IndicatorType_Create functions to allow this.

*Removed locations management table, now each indicator has its
own location options (point, relPoint, x, y). 

*Grid2Options:  Added Layout and Statuses tabs for each indicator.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed libDBLayers library and layers management stuff, configuration 
is handled in a standard way now, Grid2Options.lua config file dont exists 
anymore, Grid2.lua config has this appearance now :

[profiles]
	[namespaces]
		[Grid2Layout]
		[Grid2Frame]
		[GridBlink]
		[Grid2Layout]
	[Profile Name]
		[versions]		
		[indicators]
		[statuses]
		[statusMap]
	[Other profile]
		...
		
Added profile management and libDual spec support. A bit hackish but must work, 
some modules need major changes to support this better. Grid2 memory usage
increased by ~25k with each profile change.

Plugins must hook Grid2:UpdateDefaults() and check Grid2.db.profile.versions
to setup a default config or update database config, see Grid2RaidDebuffs.lua 
for example.

New indicator in grid2 core to show raid icons: 
raid-icon-target and raid-icon-player

Modified IndicatorBar: Health indicator background color option
works now (only if invertColors option is not enabled)

Adden Minimum heal value in StatusHeals

Renamed Grid2StatusRaidDebuffs to Grid2RaidDebuffs
Removed Grid2StatusRaidDebuffsOptions directory (code moved to Grid2Options).
Maybe i will revert this change if i will decide to make a more
complex and complete configuration window for RaidDebuffs.
  
New default configurations for all clases 

Remove categories management code (this part was not finished, and only 
was increasing de source code size)

Grid2 don't need Grid2Options to run.

Grid2Options appearance changed, and some fixes
General, layers, debug, profiles,... settings placed in Tabs

Added a simple libDatabroker launcher.
